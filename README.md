## Documentation

### **Cypress**

Cypress is a fast, reliable, and flexible JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework built for modern web applications. It simplifies testing by providing a developer-friendly API to interact with web applications, handle network requests, and capture various testing aspects such as UI components and API responses.

- **Key Features**:

  - Runs in the same environment as the application (browser)
  - Automatically waits for actions (no need for explicit waits)
  - Handles AJAX, timers, and DOM events without extra configurations
  - Provides debugging capabilities through detailed error messages, stack traces, and snapshots
  - Parallel test execution and CI/CD integration

- **Cypress Configuration**:
  You can configure Cypress using the `cypress.config.ts` file for settings such as timeouts, base URLs, and environment variables.

  Learn more at [Cypress Documentation](https://docs.cypress.io).

### **Cucumber**

Cucumber is a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) tool that allows you to write human-readable test scenarios in Gherkin syntax. It emphasizes collaboration between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders. Cucumber tests are written in plain English using the Given-When-Then structure, which makes it easy for everyone to understand the requirements.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Feature Files**: Where tests are written in Gherkin.
  - **Step Definitions**: Code that executes steps described in feature files.
  - **Tags**: Categorize tests to control execution.
- **Example Gherkin Syntax**:

  ```gherkin
  Feature: User Login
    Scenario: Valid User Login
      Given I am on the login page
      When I type "username" and "password"
      Then I should see the dashboard page
  ```

# Cypress Cucumber TypeScript UI Testing

## Features

- **UI Testing**: Allows testing of UI elements with Gherkin syntax and Cucumber steps.
- **Dynamic Alias Handling**: Captures and replaces alias values (e.g., `href` links) in request bodies and supports visiting URLs stored from API responses.
- **Cucumber BDD Support**: Write both API and UI tests in Gherkin syntax, integrated with TypeScript step definitions.

## Running Tests

### Open Cypress Test Runner

```bash
npm run cypress:open
```

This will open the interactive test runner, where you can choose API or UI test files to run.

### Headless Test Execution

To run tests locally in headless mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run cypress:run
```

To run specific tests locally in headless mode using tags, use the following command:

```bash
npm run cy:suite:account
```
